# DSaaS - Football Social Network (Twitter x Futmob)

It's a social media website for football (or sports). It's like Twitter with built in football features, like the ability to react directly to goals instead of this screenshot for example. Goals would be authorized posts made automatically. Not just posts of course but also transfers and lineups. People talk a lot about transfers. Also accounts can show the badge of the club they support next to their name.
 
There's also the possibility of a virtual currency that you can use to bet and make predictions, maybe even join leagues. Also potential for a feature like fantasy where you build your own team from existing players. All these minigames make up the virtual currency economy along with the idea of having users use the currency to collect and trade players like the classic trading cards (can vary hugely in value and can be a huge selling point). Users can of course buy this currency, though the economy should be carefully constructed.
