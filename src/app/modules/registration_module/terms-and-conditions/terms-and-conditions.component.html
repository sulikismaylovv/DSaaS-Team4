      damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury,
      for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the website, third-party

      Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Remontada concerning the Services. If any
      provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such
      provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full
      force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of
      such term or any other term, and Remontada’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement
      shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND Remontada AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE

    <h3 class="mt-4 text-md font-semibold"> 19. Waiver</h3>

      thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.
      No failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under
      this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
      right or power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the
      event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this
      Agreement shall govern.</p>
    <h3 class="mt-4 text-md font-semibold"> 20. Amendments to this Agreement</h3>
    <p> Remontada reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If a
